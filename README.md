# HTML website

Basic HTML website to serve as the main view of your work in the course.

HTML structure - Body - Header/nav/(aside|main/article section)/footer

Margin -> Border -> Padding -> Content

div - division element


const and let - var is complicated, let stays within function/scope. Const stays the same

Promises - Resolve and reject are both end results/functions, can return a string or value depending on function. Can also be used to run code at similar times, async code (async and await can also be used)

Lots of troubleshooting, but don't be afraid to stick with the code!

DOM
    -getElementByID
    -setItem
    -getItem
    -querySelector
    -innerHTML

    JSON - Parse or Stringify, always one or the other!


Lots of initializing and installing packages with npm and node.js! Express, mongodb and uuid are all pretty standard towards making a website. pm2 also helps with server management and daemons running in the backgroud
