# HTML website

Basic HTML website to serve as the main view of your work in the course.

HTML structure - Body - Header/nav/(aside|main/article section)/footer

Margin -> Border -> Padding -> Content

div - division element


const and let - var is complicated, let stays within function/scope. Const stays the same

Promises - Resolve and reject are both end results/functions, can return a string or value depending on function. Can also be used to run code at similar times, async code (async and await can also be used)
