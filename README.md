# HTML website

Basic HTML website to serve as the main view of your work in the course.

HTML structure - Body - Header/nav/(aside|main/article section)/footer

Margin -> Border -> Padding -> Content

div - division element


const and let - var is complicated, let stays within function/scope. Const stays the same

Promises - Resolve and reject are both end results/functions, can return a string or value depending on function. Can also be used to run code at similar times, async code (async and await can also be used)

Lots of troubleshooting, but don't be afraid to stick with the code!

DOM
    -getElementByID
    -setItem
    -getItem
    -querySelector
    -innerHTML

    JSON - Parse or Stringify, always one or the other!


Lots of initializing and installing packages with npm and node.js! Express, mongodb and uuid are all pretty standard towards making a website. pm2 also helps with server management and daemons running in the background

mongodb is great paired with Atlas Mongo. Be sure to use credentials that are stored on your environment (either through ssh or through the system variables) and not on the acutal git repository. That allows hackers to come in and steal everything you hold dearly and love.

Patience is key when adding in new packages :)

Websocket didn't have a ton of functionality in my website, but I still got some good practice in with Simon!
